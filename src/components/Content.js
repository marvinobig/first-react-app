                <li>J.A.R.V.I.S stands for "Just a rather very intelligent system".</li>
                <li>Tom Holland found out he got the role of spiderman through an instagram post.</li>
                <li>Bucky Barnes trained black widow when she was still in the Red Room.</li>
                <li>The word "Zombies" was trademarked by Marvel Studios in 1973.</li>
                <li>The events of Infinity War take place over 2 days.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The list above might not look like reasons but they do represent my love for the MCU in that 
                they convey why the MCU just works. The fact that everything is connected and the little details in every scene 
                that are just waiting to be discovered are the reasons why I love the MCU.
